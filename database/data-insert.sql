A hint is to consider two cases. First case is when considering the first and last characters and they are the same. Hence if the substring between them are the same then the subsequence would be the palindromic subsequence between the two plus two characters to include the ones that we are considering. Then the second case when they are not the same. Then we have to consider the subsequence after the first character and the subsequence before the last character considering. Hope this helps.', '2021-11-13 05:22:42');

It would be best if you can post a picture of the graph but from what I read you are understanding the concept wrongly.
